Within a large organization, changes move quickly. Policies are updated, regulations need to be addressed and problems need to be solved efficiently. 

Due to this volume and the need for quick turnaround, there are many people working on different changes that all impact the same tools. It’s not easy to understand all of the changes occurring, because there isn’t a way to address the pipelines for all of the BSCs without reaching out to them individually. 

When senior management wants to understand everything occurring, emails are sent and all the work that needs to be done is put on hold so that this can be provided.

There is need within the team for a repository that provides the following:

BSC Name and applicable contact information.
Project lists, broken down by whether they require funding or not (project vs enhancement).
Allowance for entry of projects within the preliminary steps (to account for BSC time   while the project is still in initial assessment) where Project Number and Scope may        not yet be set.
Ease of access to the data (print capacity).


How to use: 
After pulling up the ProjectDatabaseViewer.java, select Run.
When the User Interface appears, begin entering data.
	Items that are not required are identified (Project Number, Project Scope and/or Project Notes). Any combination of those voluntary items are allowed. Project Number is voluntary, but if entered, must be a number (it will warn you if not).
	The checkbox for Project may be checked if it’s funded (not an enhancement).
Once all information is entered, “Complete?” should be clicked. Validations will pop up if the required information was entered.
“Print Projects List” may be selected at any time. If no projects have been entered, it will provide that information. Otherwise, all of the Projects entered will be printed to the  console.
Data will disappear when the entry is accepted, allowing for a subsequent entry.
It does say ‘press enter’ but enter is not required – even if you tab through, the information will be captured.
If you close out the window, the program resets.
